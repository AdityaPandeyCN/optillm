Therefore, if Bronte Tower were to have a height of 824 feet, we can compare this to the list of tallest buildings in New York City.\n\nAs of August 2024, the tallest buildings in New York City include:\n\n1.

If the tick feeds as an adult in the Fall, it is possible for it to transmit Lyme disease during that time. However, Lyme disease is most commonly transmitted in the Spring and Summer when the ticks are active and feeding.\n\nTherefore, if an Ixodes scapularis tick nymph feeds in the Spring and becomes an adult in the same year, it is most likely to transmit Lyme disease that same Fall or, more typically, the following Spring. Hence, it can be said that the tick could transmit Lyme disease either in the same season it becomes an adult (Fall) or the next season (Spring).\n\nTo directly answer your query: it is most likely to transmit Lyme disease **one season later** in the next Spring.",

He introduced the idea of energy quanta and derived Planck's radiation law, which describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium.     2. **Albert Einstein (1921)** - Although awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921, Einstein made crucial contributions to quantum theory with his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of light.  3. **Niels Bohr (1922)** - Bohr received his Nobel Prize for his contributions to our understanding of atomic structure and radiation. His Bohr model of the atom incorporated quantum theory and explained how electrons could have stable orbits.  4. **Johannes Stark (1919)** - Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields (the Stark effect), both phenomena that provided insights into atomic structure and quantum mechanics.  5. **James Franck and Gustav Hertz (1925)** - Franck and Hertz's Nobel Prize was awarded for their experiments on electron impacts in atoms, which confirmed quantum energy levels within atoms.",

Here is a list of those laureates along with their specific contributions:\n\n1. **Max Planck (1918 Nobel Prize)**:\n   - Contribution: Planck is considered the father of quantum theory. He introduced the concept of quantization of energy, proposing that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete units called \"quanta.\" This was a fundamental shift in understanding thermal radiation and led to the development of Planck's law of black-body radiation.\n\n2. **Albert Einstein (1921 Nobel Prize)**:\n   - Contribution: Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect provided crucial evidence for the quantum theory. He proposed that light can be thought of as consisting of particles called photons, and that the energy of these photons is proportional to their frequency. This explained the phenomenon where light could eject electrons from a material, which classical wave theory could not account for.\n\n3. **Niels Bohr (1922 Nobel Prize)**:\n   - Contribution: Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, which introduced the idea of quantized energy levels for electrons in atoms. His model explained how electrons occupy discrete orbits around the nucleus and how they transition between these orbits by absorbing or emitting photons of specific energies.\n\n4. **Johannes Stark (1919 Nobel Prize)**:\n   - Contribution: Stark is known for the discovery of the Stark effect, which is the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of an electric field. This phenomenon provided insights into atomic structure and interactions, contributing to the understanding of quantum mechanics.\n\n5. **James Franck and Gustav Hertz (1925 Nobel Prize)**:\n   - Contribution: Franck and Hertz conducted experiments demonstrating the quantization of energy levels in atoms. Their work involved bombarding mercury atoms with electrons and observing the energy absorbed, confirming that electrons transition between discrete energy levels.\n\nThese contributions laid the groundwork for modern quantum mechanics and significantly advanced the understanding of atomic and subatomic processes.",

The public elementary school you attended in 1999 is likely to be part of the North Shore School District, which serves the area. \n\nIn Sea Cliff, the elementary school is called Sea Cliff Elementary School. Therefore, the name of your school is likely **Sea Cliff Elementary School**.",
